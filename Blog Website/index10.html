            <h2>1. Understand the Challenge</h2>
            <p>Climbing Everest is not just a physical endeavor but also a mental and logistical challenge. Expect extreme altitudes, harsh weather, and long durations on the mountain. Be honest about your abilities and commitment before embarking on this journey.</p>

            <h2>3. Choose the Right Expedition</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guided Expeditions:</strong> Join a reputable guided climb that provides logistics, Sherpa support, and expert leadership.</li>
                <li><strong>Route Options:</strong> The South Col (Nepal) and North Col (Tibet) routes are the most common. Research their differences to choose the best fit.</li>
                <li><strong>Permits:</strong> Obtain necessary permits, such as the climbing permit for Mount Everest and entrance fees for Sagarmatha National Park.</li>

            <h2>5. Acclimatization is Key</h2>
